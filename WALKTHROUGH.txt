                       THE STORY
================================================================

Thomas Blackwood was the lighthouse keeper who loved his wife
Eliza. When a terrible storm took her life at sea, Thomas vowed
to keep the light burning forever, waiting for her spirit to
return. He kept his vigil for years until he too passed on.

Without a keeper, the light went dark. Countless ships were
lost, their souls trapped in the eternal mist around the island.

By restoring the light, you reunite Thomas and Eliza's spirits
and free all the lost souls - including finding your own way
home.
